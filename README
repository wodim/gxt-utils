Python scripts to extract and rebuild GXT files from GTA 3.

GXT files are extracted into INI-like files that are, at least in theory,
easier to edit with any text editor. Most GXT editors I’ve found are
Windows-only, ancient, unreliable, and a fucking nuisance to work with. These
scripts should ease the pain.

Once the desired modifications have been made, the INI file can be rebuilt
into a GXT file and loaded by the game as usual.

Usage:
    $ python3 extract.py german.gxt german.gxt.ini
    [edit the file]
    $ python3 build.py german.gxt.ini german.gxt

In the “output” folder you can find the original extracted files from the game
so you can see what the INI files are meant to look like.
